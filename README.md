# Automatic online news comparison - 2015
Website that shows news from similar topics taken by online newspaper websites. I **created a language** so that it's easier to specify where the parser should look for data.

This is my final project in high school. It is composed of: 
1. **Website displaying the news** Using Bootstrap and PHP
2. **Database**: Contains data and metadata
4. **Java Interpreter**: Reads the language that specifies where to extract data in the HTML page 
5. **Java parser**: Follows instruction from the interpreter and parses the data from HTML pages

## This is a project that I did in high school when I was 18. The code is horrible and lacks of documentation.
Unfortunately I don't have the time to try to clean it. I still keep it to remind me "where do I come from"
